# Motivation for this project
I was watching Casey Neistat's [Fist Vlo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnHCw87Enq4&list=PLTHOlLMWEwVy52FUngq91krMkQDQBagYw), then this idea hit me.
What if I can categorize / organize all the VLOGs that Casey Neistat made, and analyize it?

After deciding to do this project, this [article](https://thenextweb.com/shareables/2016/12/08/casey-neistat-forever/), titled "Watching all Casey Neistat vlogs is the best way to spend your time today" was interesting too.
